I am a sociologist at the Leibniz Institute for Educational Trajectories [(LIfBi)](https://www.lifbi.de/en-us/Start/Institute/People/Person/account/4414?name=Lohmann%2cChristian) in Bamberg and a doctoral student at Goethe University Frankfurt supervised by [Prof. Dr. Birgit Becker](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/62146852/Sociology_with_a_Focus_on_Empirical_Educational_Research?locale=en) and [Prof. Dr. Jan Skopek](https://www.tcd.ie/research/profiles/?profile=skopekj) of Trinity College Dublin, where I also completed a three-month research stay.

My work is driven by an interest in how the earliest stages of life shape later opportunities and contribute to the change or persistence of social structures and inequalities. Hence, my focus lies on early childhood education, language acquisition in the context of migration, and class-based child-rearing values, approaching these topics from a longitudinal perspective and with quantitative methods. Currently, I aim to explore the role of wealth disparities in child development.

Alongside my research, I work in the Newborn Cohort of the National Educational Panel Study [(NEPS)](https://www.neps-data.de/Data-Center/Data-and-Documentation/SC1-Newborns), an innovative large-scale longitudinal study with an exceptionally broad range of competence measures starting at the age of seven months.
